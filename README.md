Note: this repo is under clean-up and is currently missing a few notebooks. It will be updated to completeness within the week. This note will be delted when code clean-up is complete.

---------------------------- 

## Summary

This is my fourth project for the Summer 2016 [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](http://thisismetis.com), which incorporated unsupervised machine learning and natural language processing. Expert wine reviews were scraped and used in K-means clustering, latent semantic analysis (LSA), and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA). Sentiment analysis was also performed to see if review sentiment was higher in vintage years.

## Blog Post

A blog post on [themodernscientist](http://themodernscientist.com) will be available the week of 2016/09/26. This text will be updated when the website is posted.
